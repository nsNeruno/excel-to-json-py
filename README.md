# excel_to_json.py

A small tool to help me dump a specificly structured Spreadsheet File into JSON, written directly into the Clipboard.

## Installing
I worked on this on macOS.
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Then
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Remarks
Update the logic under line 41 to define which columns to extract and what kind of information to process.
